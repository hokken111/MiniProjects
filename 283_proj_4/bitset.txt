	My bitset is better than the STL bitset container because it takes up less memory.
I stored my bitset in an unsigned char but treated it as an int so it would use
each one of the char's 8 bits. Also this implementation is faster because I do not have
extra memory for functions that pertain to bitsets that aren't needed for this program.
	I utilized it in my program by converting the root's property value into a vector of
unsigned chars. Then I XOR-ed the root's property value with all the other property values
to get a relevance value. Then when I went to sort, I sorted by relevance.
